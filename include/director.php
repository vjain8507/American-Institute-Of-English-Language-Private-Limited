                <p>People from all walks of life know that in order get ahead, they must learn English to be successful. Because English is so widely accepted, it has often been referred to as a global language.</p><p>English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a second language. As a result of the English language's universal nature and with today's global economy, the number of people who want to learn business English will continue to grow.</p><p>We believe in cooperative learning with authentic assessment and an inclusion of a vast range of current articles about teaching methodologies, ideal for people from all walks of life. We have diversified our teaching strategies by implementing service-learning projects and integrating technology in our classroom. These resources will help you gain the experience and expertise you need to become a successful English speaker, whether you’re a native or a qualified professional.</p><p>We use learner-centered classrooms that focus primarily on individual students’ learning. Our role is to facilitate growth by utilizing the interests and unique needs of students as a guide for meaningful instruction. These classrooms are goal-based. Students’ learning is judged by whether they achieve predetermined, developmentally-oriented objectives. Because people learn best when they hear, see, and manipulate variables, our methods are unique and oftentimes experiential.</p><p>Many institutions fall somewhere in the middle of this continuum. They are neither strictly learner-centered nor only curriculum-centered. They use what works for them based on their fundamental belief and structure.</p><p>We have been providing training in Spoken English for more than 25 years. We have courses specifically designed for school students, college students, job aspirants, professionals, those appearing in international exams, housewives and all those for whom speaking good English is the way to go.</p><p>We offer courses for beginners, adults, students and professionals as these courses improves upon fluency as well as grammar. The lessons are interactive and thus increases the attention span of the students.</p><p>We rely exclusively on the use of slides, movies, filmstrips, PowerPoint slides, photographs, illustrations, videos, or overhead transparencies. In contrast to a lecture, most of the information is presented visually, rather than orally.</p>
